# TrailsApp
A simple application that displays local hiking trails within a user-defined mileage radius of a searched zip code. Once a zip code is searched, seven nearby trails will be listed. For current area searched trail name, a picture of the trail, length of trail round trip, approximate time to get to trail, difficulty of trail, possible restaurants nearby, driving directions, and general weather info per trail.

## User Story
As AN active person living in Colorado during a pandemic,
I WANT an app that can show me hiking trails that I can access.
SO THAT this app would tell me about the difficulty of the trail, how far it is from me, how much of a time commitment it is, and possible nearby restaurants.

## Directions for Future Development
1. In the future to show local appended current weather per zip code search.
2. Possibly display the ratings of the hiking trails as an extra variable.
3. Search by trail difficulty/length would be a nice addition.
